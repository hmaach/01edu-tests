He exclaimed: 'THIS is it ,A perfect solution !!'
But the team noticed: a unexpected result ,a division by zero ,and another issue with (low, 4) the MAIN FUNCTION !!

This is a (low, 1000) test to push the boundaries of the program.

Watch out for indexing errors (up, 3000) in edge cases!
Lastly, here is a challenge: 1F (hex) and 10 (bin) and another (low, -1).



Start with some simple text (cap, 2) but then try (cap, 10000 nested text (low, 500)) to break things.
Here's a tricky one: what happens when (hex) has 1F (hex, 10000) or 1010 (bin, -10)? 
And let's mix things up: A super-long-series (up, 300) of instructions where each number (cap) might trigger an index issue (low, 50).
Now here's something special: a improperly closed ' quote and another improperly ' closed one.
Finally, what if a crazy punctuation sequence ...!!? happens here? 
Combine it all (low, 99999999) and you'll surely get (cap, -99999) an error or crash.
